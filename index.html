        <h2>Choose Your Category</h2>
        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Hangman! First choose a category to get started. You will then be redirected
            to a screen dependent on the category you chose. You will then have 6 lives to guess the
            word letter by letter. Every letter you guess that is not in the word will cost you a
            life. Don't worry if you get stuck, you can ask for a hint by clicking on the Hint button 
            Click to regenerate a new word if you want to stay in the same category or click Play 
            Again to be brought back to the home screen. Good luck and have fun :)
